# 🐟 HODOR: Hydroacoustic and Optical Dataset for Oceanic Research
### High-Quality Optical and Sonar Dataset for Research

Welcome to the official repository of the **HODOR dataset**, a unique long-term multimodal underwater dataset combining synchronized forward-looking sonar and stereo camera data, collected in the Baltic Sea via the autonomous [UFO (Underwater Fish Observatory)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2024.1425259/full) platform. HODOR supports research in object detection, tracking, and sensor fusion in challenging underwater environments.

* 🔹 Synchronized imaging sonar and stereo camera data
* 🔹 Over 400 hours of continuous sequences per sensor
* 🔹 Associated abiotic measurements (e.g., CTD, ADCP, fluorometer) 
* 🔹 Machine-learning-based annotations (coming soon)

The dataset is available at PANGAEA: [https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000)

Download the tab delimited files at [https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.980000). In this files, the download links for the camera, sonar and abundancy data are given. You can either download the complete (sub-) datasets or single files.

## Explore and interact with the dataset using our starter tools:
<!--
### 🐍 Python

* hashCheck.py: Test for integrity of the dataset
-->
### 🧠 MATLAB

* visualizeSequence.m: Display all sensor data at the same time (see example-gif above)

* analyzeCompleteSet: Runs through all dataset video files and performs statistical measurements
