# 🐟 HODOR: Hydroacoustic and Optical Dataset for Oceanic Research
### High-Quality Optical and Sonar Dataset for Research

Welcome to the official repository of the **HODOR dataset**, a unique long-term multimodal underwater dataset combining synchronized forward-looking sonar and stereo camera data, collected in the Baltic Sea via the autonomous UFO platform. HODOR supports research in object detection, tracking, and sensor fusion in challenging underwater environments.

## 📦 What's Inside

* 🔹 Synchronized imaging sonar and stereo camera data
* 🔹 Over 400 hours of continuous sequences per sensor
* 🔹 Associated abiotic measurements (e.g., CTD, ADCP, fluorometer) 
* 🔹 Ground-truth tracking annotations (coming soon)

The dataset is available at PANGAEA:
